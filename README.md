# DraggableStuff
Short, relatively simple, example of creating and dragging grid-based shapes with rotation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Demo available at:
https://devviedehm.github.io/DraggableStuff/draggable_stuff.html

Useful for helping people solve 'packing blocks into shaped maps' sort of puzzles. :)

First shape will have a green color to be used as the 'map' or background.
Can click "Snap to grid" to have every shape snap to a block-sized grid.
Left click and hold to move shapes, right click while holding a shape to rotate it by 90 degrees.
